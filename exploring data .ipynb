       "\"\\ufeffSensual Pleasures of the MindItalic text\\n\\nThere are endless creative ways to provoke and capture sensual feelings. Money can’t buy it, you can’t see it or hold it, outer\\npackaging offers no competition for it and no grandiose flash of materialistic presence can incite it. Sensuality in it’s truest sense can only be felt within.  It is provoked by and through the power and brilliance of the mind. It is born there and lives there.\\n\\nSince it is a feeling rather than a physical event, it is more difficult to achieve and maintain than might be found with other less deeply rooted sexual experiences.  Knowledge, intuition and creativity are the tools necessary to discover where it lives and how to awaken it, what it takes to stimulate it and how to nurture it so it will grow. A conscientious partner can create a need and cravings simply by using the power of the mind.    \\n\\nAll of this offers new meaning to the old adage about the mind being a terrible thing to waste. There are hot spots in the psyche that can be triggered by suggestion and connection. (Emotional Buttons)  Pushing those buttons engenders our partner's sensory and sexual experience. We do this by using one type of energy to spark another and by channeling emotional reactions into sexuality. Where the adventure leads is limited only by the knowledge, intuition and creativity an individual possesses. Nothing is written in stone and there is no list of how to’s.  It’s freelance flight.\\n\\nKnowledge is power! Getting to know your partner and what makes her/him tick and tingle is the first step. The ability to\\nunearth these secret treasures comes from paying close attention to things you say or do that result in an action or reaction\\nindicating you have your finger on a button (hot spot). Finding all of those buttons, exploring the endless possibilities and\\ndiscovering the wondrous places they lead, takes patience and thought, but the rewards are immeasurable.\\n\\nHaving well honed intuition is a valuable asset. Liken it, if you will, to a good quarter back with a natural talent for reading the defense. If you ‘know’ what your partner needs, wants and desires without her/him having to explain it all, then you hold a powerful advantage. Possessing a good base knowledge of the opposite sex, in general, offers a continual win, win proposition\\n\\nBeing gifted with a creative imagination or obtaining skills in this arena will offer many positives for a lasting and pleasurable sex life. Desires and cravings are born in the mind and live there so it would make sense to use the power of the mind to it fullest to gain the greatest results. Spice and adventure are two major factors in all sexual experiences. If they are not on the top of your list of priorities then they should be. Avoiding boredom is key in creating cravings for more. If it wasn't good the first time, why would anyone want to repeat it?  Taking your partner to a place where she/he has never been before and making each experience a lasting memory should be primary goals. That is the stuff heroes are made of.\\n\\nSexual stimulation can be achieved and sustained through physical manipulation, sexual pleasures, or through mind play and manipulation A physical presence, a verbal exchange, a mere mental/emotional connection or any combination of all of the above can create an ‘altered mental state’, a place of arousal and euphoria.\\n\\nSensual/erotic tasks and journals are great avenues to maintain altered states. Rituals and sensual tasks , while away from your\\npartner can help keep the buttons pushed, the bond strong, keep the connection flowing and offer sexual stimulation on an\\nongoing basis. Keeping your partner in an ‘altered state’ often and for as long as possible will help in creating cravings and lead to a path ultimate sexual pleasure.\\n\\nAltered states....\\n1-Sexuality.....intensely 'turned on' riding a sexual high ...erotica.....consumed by passion\\n2-Endorphin high...... an altered state resulting from physical or intense mental stimulation.\\n3-Euphoria.....totally absorbed in your partner and the sensations and feelings being created.\\n5-Head space......spellbound/entranced..lost in the release of control..total freedom and flight..to be absorbed in the trust and acceptance..a peaceful place\\n6-Nirvana......meditative state.....heightened consciousness with loss of awareness.....having a sense of self through 'losing oneself'......total freedom through total loss of control.\\n\\nAll sexual experiences need to be consensual and remain safe.\""
